# Creatorise

## Background

This project was my Exam Project for the course *Web development 1*, at Kattegattgymnasiet in Halmstad, 2020.


## Purpose

This project is supposed to be a mock website for the Photo company Creatorise.

## Development

The Creatorise webpage is a static, pure front-end oriented webpage, mainly focused on HTML and CSS with a minimal amount of JavaScript.
It features multiple pages and works in browsers for both desktop and mobile use.


### UI - Welcome Page

## Notes

I learned a lot of things during the making of this project. I do like what I've done, but there are things I would do in a better way if I were to recreate this project.
